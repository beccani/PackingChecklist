# Packing Checklist
This web app is being developed to fulfill the capstone project for my LaunchCode bootcamp.

# Project Overview
The MVP of this application will allow the user to create a packing checklist for an upcoming trip. 
They will be able to create the list add items to the list and then mark the item as packed or not packed. They will be able to save the list to come back to at a later time.

In further development, I would like to:
  - add a feature that allows the user to convert their list into a PDF fill to print out and use while packing
  - add "modules" for the user to add a standardized group of items for specific uses(ie. hiking, backpacking, theme parks, etc.)
  

# Technologies
This was developed using JavaScript with Angular as the framework, CSS and HTML.
